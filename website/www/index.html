  <h2>About this site</h2>
  <p>
    This website serves as an introduction to me and what I do. Iâ€™ve tried to keep things as simple as possible, avoiding Javascript where I can, this website should be functional as a purely html document, so feel free to disable CSS/Scripts. My favorite colour is blue.

    <h2>A little about me</h2>
    <p>
	  <img src="images/me.jpg" alt="A picture of me!" width="200">
	  My name is Anthony, I was formerly a student of Computer Science at the University of Sheffield. Before this I attended The Brunts Academy 6th form, where I studied Maths, Physics and Chemistry at A level, along with Geography and Further Maths at AS level.<br/>
	  For many years I've known that I wanted to study Computer Science, initially my interest came from the desire to create 3D video games. Throughout my time studying, I've descovered the difficulties of cohesive teamwork, strange ways of computing, all sorts of technologies and that I still love just playing with code.

	<h2>Things I enjoy</h2>
	<p>
	  With my subject choice, it's no surprise that I love all things related to technology, I love anticipating new hardware releases, reading about cool tech inventions, and most of all fiddling with programs.

	  I also enjoy reading a lot, my favourite genres include science fiction, fantasy and history. History interests me a lot. I find early modern European history a blast to read about, due to all the power strugles and conflict, it's just as fun as reading A Game of Thrones. A couple of books I've recently read and enjoyed are Iron Kingdom: 'The Rise and Downfall of Prussia' and 'Vanished Kingdoms'. I'm a big fan of Philip K. Dick's science fiction novels and short stories, a couple of favourites include 'We Can Remember It for You Wholesale' and 'We Can Build You'. I still hold a place in my heart for all the great fantasy I read when I was younger - I sometimes go back and re read some. <br/> Image curtsey of <a href="http://www.freedigitalphotos.net/">freedigitalphotos</a> / koratmember.
