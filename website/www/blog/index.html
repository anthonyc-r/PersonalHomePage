      <div class="body"><p>I went back and tried a little functional programming recently. Erlang was my language of choice, although I didn't use any of it's concurrent features. I do intend to go back over my concurrent systems notes and plan a system in Pi Calculus and then converting it into an erlang program as I enjoyed this a lot. Anyhow, I did a little excercise program to convert hundu numerals into roman numerals. It's been a while since I'd used functional languages, but I remember why I love them, everything is so compact!</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>I've tended to avoid Javascript where at all possible, and aviod Javascript libraries like the plague and take a DIY approach to my projects. But, all things must change, and since so many jobs seem to require this, I figured I'd dive in. I made this little slideshow thing that you see (if you have script enabled!) on this page. Honestly, I've used it a tiny bit in the past (really only for .ready) Using a few more of it's features this time around and I guess I agree that it really does speed things up. At the end of the day I think I prefer to do things from scratch.</p></div>
