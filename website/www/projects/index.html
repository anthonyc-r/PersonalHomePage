  <!-- intro -->
  <p>
    Here I’ve picked a few of my favorite practical assignments from my degree, in addition to a number of personal projects that I’ve worked on. Including the first ever ‘game’ I made, check out text adventure to see this. This page is still under construction, a page for each project listed here is the goal.
  </p>
  <!-- Uni -->
  <h2>University Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="byteman/index.html">Byteman</a> - A pacman clone I made for first year's web project.</li>
    <li><a href="email-db/index.html">Email Database</a> - A user submits an email address in text form, which is stored as an image such that web crawlers cannot see it.</li>
	<li><a href="dominoes/index.html">Dominoes</a> - The game of dominoes implemented in Haskell, along with some AI players.</li>
    <li>Character Recognition - This python script takes a photo of a wordsearch, and using character recognition solves it.</li>
    <li>Robot Waiter - A 3D scene of a robot waiter moving around a restaurant. Uses Java + JOGL bindings.</li>
    <li>8 Puzzle Search - Finding the solution to an 8 puzzle using search algorithms.</li>
    <li>Time Management System - For healthcare workers to log their hours in addition to other features such as note taking and travel time estimation.</li>
    <li>Creating Guillemot Eggs - My 3rd year project involving the creation of a simulation to create realistic looking egg textures.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- Personal -->
  <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="home-page/index.html">Home Page</a> - A cool retro terminal themed home page I made one afternoon.</li>
    <li><a href="maze-game/index.html">Marble Maze Game</a> - A 3D marble maze game I made using WebGL.</li>
	<li><a href="text-adventure/index.html">Text Adventure</a> - A little text game I made in C++ when I was 14 or so.</li>
    <li><a href="webgl-text-fun/index.html">WebGL Text Fun</a> - Playing with a font atlas loader I made. Ended up with a cool creepy look, it would be neat to write a propper ascii generator and add an export as webm feature.</li>
	<li>Radio Desu - I wish I didn't lose the code for this. I made a neat radio station that allowed listeners to upload and then immediately request any songs they like. It made use of liquidsoap, icecast, MySQL, PHP and a fairly hefty bash scrip that probably should have been implemented on the PHP side of things... It was fun.</li>
    <li>Estiana - Work In Progress, I hope to return to this after polishing up my skills on a WebGL project I will be working on. A 2D sandbox game written in Java.</li>
  </ul>
