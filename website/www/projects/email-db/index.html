	This project's aim was to keep a database of email addresses without storing any in plain text, such that any webcrawlers would not be able to retrieve them for malicious use.
	It made use of HTML, JS, CSS, PHP, MySQL. As part of the assignment we designed our own database schemas with justification. Hence after this assignment we were familiar with setting up and using a LAMP stack. Our knowledge of relational databases was further expanded in the second year, as we learned about normalisation.

	Security was also considered, ensuring any information used by MySQL was escaped as to prevent SQL injection.
