	  Ever since an early age I've enjoyed problem solving and understanding how systems work, this manifested itself in a purely destructive since, taking electric toy cars apart, small speakers and things like this. What makes this thing move? How does this make noises? At first failing to actually put them back together again, but eventually managing it. This interest persisted throughout my childhood, with age I found different ways of expressing these interests. When I first received a computer at 11, kind of late compared to many people maybe, my toy cars and speakers became software and video games. First exploring the system on a high level, finding out how the things I'm running depend on files, how changing these can result in interesting outcomes, especially in the case of video game resources and configuration files. Real  desire to understand and learn about computer programming came when I discovered the game Roblox, at around 13, this allowed players to use the Lua scripting language to create awesome things in game and bring them in to an online multiplayer environment, flying dragons made out of blocks stringed together and scripted to respond to keyboard input, cars, trapped houses – pretty much anything. I guess this could best be described now as Minecraft plus Lua scripting. From there my interest in computer programming really exploded, the ability to create tools, worlds and all sorts of things with a language excited and still excites me greatly. Given this, and discovering that I genuinely enjoyed mathematics during my A level studies, when it came to thinking about my degree, the choice was obvious.

	  I studied computer science at the University of Sheffield, chosen due to its high quality of education and pleasant location. Sheffield has a great atmosphere. I started studying computer science in September of 2013, and am pleased with the degree. I've learnt some amazing things and have been introduced to many areas of computer science I had never realised existed, bio inspired computing for example, the ideas introduced to me such as evolutionary algorithms have been both interesting and exciting.
