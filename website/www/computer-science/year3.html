    <!-- intro -->
	<p>
	  This year we got to choose pretty much all of our modules, other than the mandatory law and finance module, which honestly I find a little dull – although there are some neat anecdotes during it! Did you know the inventor of the ring pull can receives 1p for every can using it for 20 years, and due to a smart patent lawyer, also received 1p for every can using the updated ring pull, the one we all know and love. I got to pick some modules which really interested me, though, including 3D graphics, and this has been especially rewarding. In addition to our selected modules, we have our individual project, which is a self-managed project, requiring good time management and also a hell of a lot of self-motivation.
  </p>
	<!-- 3DCG -->
	<h2>3D Computer Graphics</h2>
	<p>
	  My favorite module so far. 3D graphics exemplifies everything I love about programming, writing a bunch of commands and being rewarded with the gift of creation, but in this case, you don’t just create a tool, you create a world. Rather than just teaching the openGL API, this module’s lectures focus on the theory behind everything, while practical sessions introduce the API, which is a great structure, as the API is so much easier to understand knowing the whys behind it all. Covering the fixed function graphics pipeline, newer techniques such as volumetric shadows and ray tracing, this has allowed me to create some pretty neat stuff, which is so rewarding. The main assignment of this module involved creating a scene with a robot waiter moving between tables in a restraint scene. Check out the projects page for a look at this.
	</p>
	<!-- Text Processing -->
	<h2>Text Processing</h2>
	<p>
	  This module looks at the various aspects of text processing, for example information retrieval techniques involved in search engine creation and translation.
	</p>
	<!-- Law and Finance -->
	<h2>Law and Finance</h2>
	<p>
	  As the name suggests, this mandatory module teaches us about aspects of the law such as common law, case precedence and how it affects us as engineers. The finance section looks at management accounting and finance accounting. This is assessed by a formal examination. Not my highlight of the year.
	</p>
  <!-- Theory of Distrebuted Systems -->
  <h2>Theory of Distributed Systems</h2>
  <p>
    We looked at the calculus of communicating systems (CCS), and how it can be used to model and check that systems running in parallel work, and whether two different systems are similar or bisimilar. The module also took a look at a different approach to modeling concurrency with CSP, Communicating Sequential Processes. Following this, we looked at the Pi calculus, and how it can be used to model concurrency in mobile networks, by allowing channel names to be communicated. For the practical side, the module featured Erlang programming exercises, implementing models specified in CCS or Pi calculus.
  </p>
  <!-- The Intelligent Web -->
  <h2>The Intelligent Web</h2>
  <p>
   This was about creating highly interactive web applications, making use of the web of data. It involved using a NodeJS website backend, along with standard JS/HTML/CSS front ends, to query the twitter API, retreieve and store data. This was assessed entirely by a single practical assignment, that was to create a web application to scour twitter, wikidata for relevant information about a query  involving football, and display it along with some extra information about the result – top 10 most active tweeters, etc. 
  </p>
  <!-- Computer Security and Forensics -->
  <h2>Computer Security and Forensics</h2>
  <p>
    This covered the principles of computer security, various types of encryption methods and the possible attacks on them. Assessed by exam.
  </p>
	<!-- Individual Project -->
	<h2>Individual Project</h2>
	<p>
	  My project involved figuring out potential mechanisms behind the maculation found on the shells of the common guillemot, and creating a simulation demonstrating it using 3D computer graphics. The common guillemot is a really unique sea bird, it doesn’t lay its eggs in a nest, and the eggs themselves are totally unique, with wild markings and lines featuring all over their eggs. There are a few explanations for this, for example, the guillemot lays its eggs in a very dense population, and so having such a unique marking might make it easier to identify their own egg in a sea of other bird’s eggs, if both parents must leave. In addition to this marking, the egg has a neat pyriform shape, it was suggested that this was to stop it from rolling off of cliff ledges, but the rotation this creates doesn’t do a whole lot to stop them from falling off of ledges, so this might be unlikely. My project involved simulating the formation of these markings in order to gain a better understanding of the real biological process involved. There was a lot of self-motivation and time management involved in this project, which was quite hard, but also rewarding.
