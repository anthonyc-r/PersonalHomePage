  <!-- Description of the topics covered by each module -->
  <article>
    <!-- intro -->
	<p>
	  The first year served as a general introduction and grounding for the more advanced topics covered in later years. Computer architecture systems was particularly interesting, it was incredibly rewarding to build up from the basics, such as logic gates, all the way up to a basic processor. The software engineering module was also very rewarding, as it provided the first opportunity of the year to work in a team, and the task itself was to design a very simplistic rogelike game, involving navigating the monitor’s maze, I enjoyed that a lot. 
	</p>
	<h2>Software Engineering</h2>
	<!-- Soft eng -->
	<p>
	  This module aimed to teach the principles of software engineering, and how it differs from ‘coding’ and computer science. The module covered why we need software engineering in the first place, large motivators being disasters caused by poor team work and planning such as Arianne 5. The key software engineering processes were explained in detail, including specification, design, implementation and verification, and the different models of doing this were covered, for example the waterfall model, evolutionary, iterative and agile models. Initial planning was examined in detail, including methods of scoping, resource and time estimation, project scoping, risk analysis and scheduling. Parts of UML were included, use case diagrams, class diagrams and x machines were introduced. This module provided a really in depth view of the methods used to ensure that a project is successful by emphasizing organization, team work and detailed documentation.
	</p>
	<!-- Foundations -->
	<h2>Foundations of Computer Science</h2>
	<p>
	  Covering various aspects of discrete and continuous mathematics, as I enjoyed A level mathematics before this, this module was great fun. The module covered various topics including; Boolean algebra, predicate and propositional logic, proof strategies and relations. The second semester focused more on continuous mathematics, looking at properties of integers and modular arithmetic, matrices, and probability. Each of these was looked at in some depth.
	</p>
	<!-- Java -->
	<h2>Java Programming</h2>
	<p>
	  Over the year this provided a thorough grounding in the Java programming language, covering all of the basics of imperative programming, and then teaching Object-Oriented techniques. The course taught Java 7, but I have since examined and learned the features added in Java 8. This course set us up perfectly to go on and learn new features and other object oriented/imperative languages with ease. One of the more interesting assignments during this module was having to program a Lego mindstorm robot to navigate a course by scanning barcodes specifying which direction to turn next, lots of fun!
	</p>
	<!-- Web and internet tech -->
	<h2>Web and Internet Technology</h2>
	<p>
	  The first half focused on client-side scripting and markup, covering HTML4, and some of the features introduced by HTML5, new tags etc, JavaScript and CSS, including some of the shiny CSS3 features that were usable on some browsers back then, such as transitions and animations. The assignment was to create our own personal web page, including use of the HML5 canvas, I made a rather buggy <strike>byteman game</strike> pacman clone for that part, which you can find on the projects page. The second half taught the server side of things, using PHP to create dynamic page content. At the end of this semester we produced a web-app to store user emails as images, supposedly solving the issue of web crawlers picking up email addresses stored as text and adding them to spam lists.
	</p>
	<!-- Machines and int -->
	<h2>Machines and Intelligence</h2>
	<p>
	  Split into the two parts suggested by the module title, the first semester introduced how widespread machine learning had become, its use in product suggestion, search engines, etc. After it went on to cover a number of methods involved in machine learning, introducing classification using the perceptron, regression and clustering. This module went extremely fast and was very difficult to understand. Luckily the data driven computing module in the later year picked up from this and made it much more understandable in retrospective. The second semester looked at how to solve some types of problems through search and using this in game playing.
	</p>
	<!-- Comp sys arch -->
	<h2>Computer Systems Architecture</h2>
	<p>
	  Probably my favorite module of the year, this essentially taught us how computers actually compute, and how the internet works. The first semester of this focused on the hardware side of things, Boolean logic, forming circuits out of logic gates, designing logic circuits to perform addition, instruction set architecture and much more. In order to teach assembly language, the Motorola 68K was used. The latter half concerned itself with network architecture and the algorithms and protocols involved.
